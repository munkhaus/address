# Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) Report

## Overview

This report assesses the application for the presence of Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) features. RASP mechanisms are designed to detect and respond to attacks or unauthorized behavior in real-time while the application is running. This includes capabilities like debugger detection, anti-tampering, root/jailbreak detection, and more.

## Review Sources

*   `pubspec.yaml` (dependency list)
*   Native code: `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/flutter_application_9/MainActivity.kt`
*   Native code: `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`
*   Dart service classes and core utilities.
*   Previous findings from platform-specific security reviews.

## Findings

### 1. RASP Libraries in `pubspec.yaml`

*   A review of the `pubspec.yaml` file's dependencies did not identify any packages commonly known for providing comprehensive RASP functionalities. The project's dependencies are primarily focused on UI, state management, API communication, mapping, and location services.

### 2. Custom RASP Implementations in Native Code

*   **Debugger Detection:** No code was found in `MainActivity.kt` (Android) or `AppDelegate.swift` (iOS) that attempts to detect if a debugger is attached to the application process.
*   **Anti-Tampering:** No mechanisms such as code signature verification at runtime or checksum validation of application files were identified.
*   **Root/Jailbreak Detection:** As noted in the `platform_specific_security_report.md`, no features to detect rooted (Android) or jailbroken (iOS) environments are implemented.
*   **Emulator/Simulator Detection:** Similarly, no features to detect if the app is running on an emulator (Android) or simulator (iOS) are implemented.
*   **Anti-Reverse Engineering (Runtime):** While Flutter's `--obfuscate` build flag provides a level of protection against static reverse engineering, no active runtime anti-reverse engineering or anti-debugging techniques were observed in the codebase.

### 3. Custom RASP Implementations in Dart Code

*   A review of the Dart service classes and core utilities did not reveal any custom RASP logic. The Dart code is focused on application features and state management.

## Conclusion on RASP Presence

**The application does not currently implement any identifiable RASP features.** Neither dedicated RASP libraries nor custom-coded RASP techniques (like debugger detection or anti-tampering) are present in the codebase.

## Relevance to the Application

Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) is an advanced security measure typically employed in applications with a higher risk profile, such as those handling:
*   Highly sensitive user data (e.g., financial information, health records).
*   Proprietary algorithms or valuable intellectual property embedded in the app.
*   In-app purchases or financial transactions.
*   Strong requirements to prevent cheating or unauthorized access in gaming or regulated environments.

For the current application—an address finder that uses public map data, does not involve user accounts, and does not store sensitive user data locally—the absence of extensive RASP features is not considered a critical vulnerability. Basic protections like code obfuscation (a build-time measure) and platform-specific features (like Android's `FLAG_SECURE`) offer a baseline level of security appropriate for its current functionality and risk profile.

If the application's scope were to expand to include sensitive user data, user authentication, or paid features, the implementation of RASP techniques would become a more relevant consideration.
